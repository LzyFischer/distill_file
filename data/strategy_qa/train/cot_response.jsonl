The Jackson 5's peak as a group was shorter.

There are certainly interpretations of the Golden Rule that focus more on fairness and reciprocity, which might be more compatible with Hammurabi's Code.

Saltwater crocodiles are the largest living reptiles, reaching lengths of over 20 feet and weighing over a ton.  Alligators typically reach 11-15 feet and weigh considerably less. This size and strength advantage gives the saltwater crocodile a massive edge in direct combat.\n\n2. **Bite Force:** Saltwater crocodiles have the strongest bite force of any animal, significantly surpassing that of alligators. This powerful bite would be devastating to an alligator.\n\n3. **Aggression:** Saltwater crocodiles are known for their aggression and territoriality, while alligators are generally less aggressive. This difference in temperament further favors the crocodile.\n\n4. **Habitat:** Lake Urmia, while hypersaline, is still a lake environment.  While saltwater crocodiles prefer coastal estuaries and brackish waters, they can tolerate and thrive in freshwater lakes. Alligators also thrive in freshwater. Therefore, the lake environment doesn't give a significant advantage to either species.\n\n5. **Overall:** The saltwater crocodile's significantly greater size, strength, bite force, and aggression gives it a massive advantage over the alligator.\n\nNo.\n"}

The stories are largely self-contained, although some recurring characters and organizations appear.\n\n2. **Doctor Who format:** Typically involves the Doctor, a time-traveling alien, arriving in a new time and place, encountering a problem or mystery, investigating and often facing dangerous creatures or situations, resolving the issue, and then departing in the TARDIS.

Both use a predominantly episodic format, with individual stories having a beginning, middle, and end.\n\n4. **Key difference:** While both are episodic, James Bond stories are grounded in a realistic (albeit heightened) world of espionage. Doctor Who is science fiction/fantasy, featuring time travel, aliens, and other fantastical elements.

Snow leopards are native to the high, mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. These regions are characterized by rocky terrain, cliffs, and sparse vegetation.\n\n2. While their habitat includes rivers and streams, these bodies of water are generally fast-flowing and cold, not places where swimming would be a regular activity for survival.\n\n3.  There is limited documented evidence of snow leopards swimming, and it is not considered a primary behavior for hunting or escape.\n\n4.  While they may cross shallow water if necessary, there's no indication that they are adept swimmers like tigers or jaguars, which utilize swimming for hunting and cooling.\n\n5.  Most feline species can swim if they need to, but it is not a preferred activity for snow leopards given their environment.\n\nNo.\n"}
