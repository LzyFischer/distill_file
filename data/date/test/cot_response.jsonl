The passage states that May 6, 1992 is \"ten years ago\" from Jane's perspective. This means Jane is thinking it's currently 1992 + 10 = 2002.\n\n2. The question asks for the date one year ago from *today*, not from Jane's perspective. Since Jane thinks it's 2002, and the passage implies it's actually 2012 (since 1992 was ten years ago), the question actually wants the date one year before 2012.\n\n3. One year before 2012 is 2011.  The question asks for the date in MM/DD/YYYY format.  The passage was written before 2012, so we'll assume \"today\" refers to a day in 2012. Since May 6, 1992 is the anchor date and the question doesn't specify a different \"today\", we can assume \"today\" is May 6, 2012. One year prior is May 6, 2011.\n\n4.  In MM/DD/YYYY format, this is 05/06/2011. This isn't an option. Let's assume the question was written around the time the date in the question (May 6, 1992) was actually ten years ago, meaning around 2002.  Then \"today\" would be around May 6, 2002. One year prior is May 6, 2001.\n\n5. 05/06/2001 matches answer choice D.\n\nThe best answer is D.\n"}

Option B (11/22/2000) is the only option that is in 2000.\n\nThe best answer is B.\n"}
