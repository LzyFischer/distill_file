", "label": "entailment", "reason": "according to the text, The Kit Kat chocolate bar made its debut in Japan in 1973 and since then a variety of flavors -- from green tea to wasabi -- have been produced, which means if  they have been so many produced it is because they like it. ", "response": "1. The passage states that Nestle is seeking to lure Japanese holiday shoppers with a gold-wrapped Kit Kat. This implies Nestle believes there is a market for Kit Kats among Japanese shoppers.\n\n2. The passage further states that the Kit Kat made its debut in Japan in 1973 and since then a variety of flavors have been produced.  The continued production of Kit Kats in Japan, especially with unique flavors tailored to the Japanese market, further suggests a demand for the product.\n\n3.  While the passage indicates Nestle is targeting Japanese holiday shoppers and that Kit Kats are popular enough to warrant special editions, it doesn't definitively state that *all* or *most* Japanese people like Kit Kats.  It just implies a sufficient level of popularity to justify selling this product.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is **Neither**.\n"}
