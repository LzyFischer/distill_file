Let's analyze the options:\n\n* **A. getting fat:** This is a possible consequence of prolonged inactivity, but it's not a guaranteed outcome of simply watching TV.  Someone could be watching TV while exercising, for example.\n* **B. get fat:** Grammatically incorrect and similar in reasoning to A.\n* **C. typing words:** This is irrelevant to the question.  The question specifies \"accomplishing nothing.\" Typing words implies some level of activity and accomplishment.\n* **D. falling asleep:** While possible, falling asleep isn't a direct consequence of watching television and doesn't address the core of \"accomplishing nothing.\"  One could accomplish nothing while remaining awake.\n* **E. wasted time:** This directly addresses the \"accomplishing nothing\" aspect of the question. Watching TV without any other productive activity implies that the time spent was not used effectively.\n\nThe best answer is E.\n"}]}
